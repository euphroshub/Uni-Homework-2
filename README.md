Description of the assignment:


In context :
The owner of a chalet rental center seeks your knowledge in the design of
software and wants you to produce a program in console mode allowing it to
manage the rental of its chalets and its employees.

Objective 1: Identification of classes and methods based on the needs of the
customer
In this work, it is up to you to identify the different classes, variables and methods
allowing the design and development of the program (we can provide you with assistance
(consultation) during troubleshooting sessions).

Description of customer needs:
The owner wants you to produce software in console mode allowing him to
manage chalets and employees (maintains chalets).

The owner has several chalets throughout Quebec. Each of its chalets has a name (ex:
Trudel Manor) and a unique 5-digit identification number. In addition, he wishes to be able
keep for each of its chalets its city and its address, its number of rooms, if the
chalet is rented or not and associated or not with a maintenance employee.

Regarding the management of its employees, the owner would like to be able to keep the list of
its employees and the following characteristics concerning each employee: his name and
first name, salary, city, list of 7 entries representing availability (available or
no) for each day of the week and finally the list of chalets they maintain
(maximum 3).

In addition, the owner would like to keep in the program the number of employees and the
number of chalets he owns.
